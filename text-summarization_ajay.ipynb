This ensures that the text is in a consistent format, which is crucial for tasks like text summarization or machine learning.\n",
    "* **Adding Tokens**: The start (_START_) and end (_END_) tokens are added to the 'headlines' to indicate the beginning and end of the summary. This is often done in sequence-to-sequence models, such as those used in text generation or summarization, to help the model understand where the summary starts and ends.\n",
